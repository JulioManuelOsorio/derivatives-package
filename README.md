Currently, i'm working on a project to develop a package in Python to work with financial derivatives - and, more specifically, with options. At the current stage, I have two modules: a module called "main", that hosts a class called Option (used to work with financial options) and a module called "volatility", that hosts some functions used to calculate metrics of volatility of financial assets. 
The package is at a very early stage, so the code may not be as good as it should be. Also, the organization of the files isn't, at all, correct for a package. This problem will be properly solved as soon as the core of the package is finished.
